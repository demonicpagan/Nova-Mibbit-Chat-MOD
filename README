+--------------------------------------------------------

The following application will add a Mibbit chat application to your Nova management system. To install this
application you need to perform the following steps.

1. Edit the contents of application/controllers/main.php editing the following variables. The file documents
what these are.
	*Line 52 - $nickname = 'ArcherGuest'.mt_rand(100,999);
	*Line 56 - $widgetid = '03e4680ec2241a0e626034fe231f27d7';
	*Lines 59-61

2. Upload application/controllers/main.php to your application/controllers folder of your Nova install replacing 
the existing one if you haven't already modified this file. If you already have changes in this file, it's best 
that you just take the contents of this file and add it into your existing main.php file.

3. Upload application/views/_base_override/main/pages/main_chat.php to your
application/views/_base_override/main/pages folder of your Nova install.

4. Log into your Nova management system and add a Chat menu item so your users can access your Mibbit chat page.
You will use the link of main/chat when you create the menu item.
